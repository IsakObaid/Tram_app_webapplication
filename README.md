# Tram_app_webapplication
I built a Python-based web application inspired by the Västtrafik app. It calculates the shortest and fastest tram routes, shows departure times, and handles transfers using JSON-based data. The project focuses on pathfinding algorithms, backend logic, and structured data management.
